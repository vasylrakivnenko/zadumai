Pre-Tier 0 v2: answer a yes/no question by matching concept frames, with no
model. Runs in shadow mode for now (router/pretier0.py records its answer;
it doesn't decide).

    1. Normalize words: lowercase, then a lemma table built from the lexicon
       at import (shares/sharing/shared -> share, paid -> pay); words outside
       the lexicon get a crude suffix stem on both sides.
    2. Tag concepts with a phrase trie, longest match first:
       "information about you" -> USER_DATA, "advertising partners" ->
       ADVERTISERS, "may" -> MAY, "shall not" -> NOT. Boilerplate such as
       "including without limitation" is tagged NEUTRAL and ignored.
    3. The question becomes a frame, one of two kinds:
       - action: who (actor), does what (action; "or" gives alternatives),
         to what (things), and what it asks (does / can / must / is it
         prohibited). "A party" is any party. Words outside the lexicon
         become literal slots that must appear as they are.
       - property: a thing and an attribute ("Is the license
         non-transferable?", "Is a party's liability capped?").
    4. A sentence clause answers only if it has the whole frame and no
       blocker (unless, except, subject to, if, without...). For an action
       the actor must come before the action; its modality decides:
       NOT -> "no" ("yes" to "is it prohibited");  MAY -> "yes" to "can",
       "yes, may" to "does", defer to "must";  MUST/DOES -> "yes". A
       property is only ever answered "yes", and not if negated.
    Anything missing, blocked, or two sentences disagreeing -> defer.
Since 2026-10-01 (STATUS.md, "Pre-Tier 0 next level"): questions are first put in the frame's shape
(router/qshapes.py: "Does the agreement require X to Y?" -> "Must X Y?", a leading condition moves to the end,
passives); the question's named subject must be the one acting; a verb the lexicon lacks is matched as written
(OPEN); conditions must be of the same kind ("after" is not "during" or "except"); presence frames keep the
question's relations (_presence_guards); the document's own names for its confidential information count as it.
