"""
Answer a question about a user's document with one of our free classifiers
when the question is one we cover, and with an LLM (Jev, or Kev locally)
otherwise.

    0a. Pre-Tier 0 (optional, router/pretier0.py): regex preparation, ~1 ms;
       answers only when certain: "Is X discussed?" when one sentence holds
       every word of X, and questions one clause's frame settles. It rewords the question for Tier 0 in "we/you" documents.
    0b. Tier 0 (optional, router/tier0.py): a local NLI model answers
       yes/no when one sentence of the document settles the question; no
       LLM call. Otherwise it defers and the steps below run.
    1. Route: Jev reads the QUESTION only and picks a menu task or
       none_of_these (router/menu.py).
    2. Gate: trust the pick only if p(none_of_these) < P_NONE_MAX and the
       pick leads the runner-up by at least MARGIN_MIN.
    3. Policy: tasks where our free model is weak (router/bank.py) are
       answered by the LLM with the task's own question.
    4. Text check: the LLM confirms the document is the kind of text the
       task's classifier was trained on ("Is this text a commercial
       contract...?").
    5. Classify: clause/sentence-level families split long documents into
       units, classify each one, and answer "yes" if any unit says yes.
    Any failed step falls back to the LLM, asked the user's own question as
    a yes/no (noul) question about the document.

Only the question goes to the router. With `llm` = Kev, the document never
leaves the machine.
